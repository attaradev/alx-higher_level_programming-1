## What is Python

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), Python is a high-level, general purpose programming language. It's dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. 

Python was developed by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) who started working on it in the 1980s as a successor to the [ABC (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)). It was first released in 1991 as `Python 0.9.0`

## Files Guide Checker

The [pycodestyle ](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) is a tool for checking Python code for style conventions. This tool was used to check all `.py` files against style conventions in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
